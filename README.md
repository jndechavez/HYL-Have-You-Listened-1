HYL-Have You Listened: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Practices Application system development would include different essential components and features. The following is an outline of the system development process for such an app: </p>
  * Requirements: The initial stage would be to gather requirements by performing research and understanding the target audience. This would entail determining the app's aims and objectives, the intended user base, and the precise features and functionalities required.
  * User Interface Design: Once the requirements have been obtained, the following stage is to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The design should be visually appealing, simple to navigate, and correspond with the tastes of the target demographic. It should also include branding components and be consistent throughout the app.
  *  Development: Throughout this phase, the app should have features relevant to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) practices, such as self-assessment tools, cognitive restructuring exercises, guided meditation and relaxation activities, and psychoeducation resources. These tools assist users in evaluating their mental health, setting personal objectives, challenging negative thought patterns, and improving mindfulness. 
  * Testing: Thorough testing should be performed to guarantee that the app performs as intended and is free of bugs and problems. This covers functional, usability, compatibility, and performance testing. 
  * Review: The method promotes the importance of regular reviews and evaluations. This allows the development team to assess its progress and identify areas for improvement in the upcoming sprint. 
  * Launch: The method focuses on the system's progressive and iterative implementation. This allows the team to make any necessary changes or improvements to the system before it is fully implemented by providing early input from users.
